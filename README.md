# STUDENT_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM
Designed and developed a Student Management System leveraging Java, Servlets, JDBC with MySQL database.


<p>
🧐 I meticulously designed and developed a robust Student Management System utilizing a powerful stack of Java, Servlets, JDBC, and a MySQL database. This comprehensive system serves as a dynamic platform for efficiently managing student data, academic records, and administrative tasks.
🚀 One of the key highlights of this project is the implementation of the Factory Design Pattern, a structural pattern that promotes scalability and maintainability. This pattern facilitates the creation of objects without specifying the exact class of object that needs to be instantiated. By adopting this pattern, the codebase achieves a high level of flexibility, making it easier to add new features and adapt to changing requirements over time.
📚 The Student Management System boasts essential functionalities, including student registration, enrollment management, course assignment, and grade tracking. Through JDBC, it establishes a seamless connection with the MySQL database, optimizing data retrieval, storage, and management.
💼 This project underscores my expertise in Java-based web application development, database integration, and the application of design patterns to create efficient, scalable, and maintainable software solutions. It exemplifies my commitment to delivering systems that streamline processes and enhance productivity in educational institutions and similar domains.
